To Understand this repository Please read "READMe.md" file.
this is eclipse Java Project Structure,so Java files are in src folder.<br>

In this repository, I have posted task-5 that I completed during my internship at "CodSoft".  <br>

I have completed Internship 'Task 5', which involves creating a "Address Book System".  I have made Console based Menu Driven Address Booking System using Core Java concepts.<br>
Where admin can add contact , remove contact, search particular contact. display all contacts.<br>
there are 3 files, but if you have to run it you have to run 'ConsoleAddressBookApp.java' file. <br>
file name = Address.java    <br>
file name = Contact.java    <br>
file name = AddressBook.java    <br>
main method file name = ConsoleAddressBookApp.java    <br>
